# Curiosity_Code
Curiosity Code in Processing


# GOALS For This Assignment

1. Practicing using Processing 
2. Practice using the functions you know in Processing 
3. Understand draw order and command ordering 
4. Understand the Processing 2D coordinate systems 
5. Code an original drawing, show effort.




# REQUIREMENTS 

I believe there needs to be a certain amount of curiosity in CODING.
A curiosity in the making of things and seeing how things work, or don’t work. 
There will be a lot of “Guess and Check”

Code an original drawing in Processing, using the functions you know.
I wanted to make an avocado, so I search for an image. First I found a photograph, but it seemed too complex to code. So I searched for an illustration of an avocado and found this:


Then I took some time to code this:





# RESOURCES 
Some of this information will help you with your lab. 

Use all of the functions you know.
You need to figure out what numbers to plug in to get the desired behavior: 

1. ellipse(?, ?, ? , ?) ( x, y coordinates, width, height )
2. size(?, ?) 

Note that when drawing a shape you can control some of its properties. 

Commands that are useful are: 

• stroke(r, g, b); ( 0-255, 0-255, 0-255 )
• fill(r, g, b); 
• noStroke();



# NAMING Convention

“YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Curiosity.Drawing”
“ . “ periods in between words


# SAVE your image

Cut and Paste this function into the LAST line of your code to save an image ( .png file format ) to your sketch folder.


//save function
save(““YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Curiosity.Drawing.png");




# GRADING 

You will be graded on your creativity and your EFFORT. 
It took me about an hour to code my avocado.
